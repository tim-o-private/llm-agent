# Architecture Principles

This document has moved to a skill for progressive disclosure:

- **Quick reference:** `.claude/skills/architecture-principles/SKILL.md` — principle table with one-liners and enforcement
- **Full rationale & examples:** `.claude/skills/architecture-principles/reference.md` — read when the one-liner isn't enough

All agents should read the SKILL.md before starting work. The reference.md is for when you encounter a novel situation and need the full reasoning behind a principle.
