# Holistic Attention & Time Allocation Rubric

This framework encourages thinking about *quality* of attention as well as *quantity* of time for a human working in tech with a family.

1.  **Professional/Work Focus:**
    *   **Primary Income Pursuit:** (e.g., Job applications, interviews, networking for traditional roles). This is high priority given your current situation.
    *   **Business Development/Maintenance:** (e.g., STLVR, Sunday Carpenter - allocated *intentionally* based on current goals and capacity, perhaps less urgent than primary income).
    *   **Professional Development:** (e.g., Learning new skills, staying current in your field).

2.  **Family & Relationship Focus:**
    *   **Partner/Spousal Time:** (Dedicated time for connection, communication, shared activities).
    *   **Childcare & Parenting:** (Direct care, quality time, school involvement, activities).
    *   **Household Management:** (Chores, maintenance, finances, planning).
    *   **Extended Family:** (Connecting with parents, siblings, etc.).

3.  **Health & Well-being Focus:**
    *   **Physical Health:** (Exercise, healthy eating, sleep hygiene).
    *   **Mental & Emotional Health:** (Mindfulness, relaxation, managing stress, seeking support if needed).
    *   **Rest & Recovery:** (Downtime, breaks, vacations).

4.  **Personal Growth & Interests Focus:**
    *   **Hobbies/Passions:** (e.g., Japanese woodworking - dedicated time for enjoyment and skill development).
    *   **Learning & Reading:** (For personal enrichment, not just professional).
    *   **Reflection & Planning:** (Time to think, set goals, review progress - like what we're doing now).

5.  **Social & Community Focus:**
    *   **Friends:** (Connecting with friends, social outings).
    *   **Community Involvement:** (Volunteering, local groups, etc.).

6.  **Logistical & Admin Focus:**
    *   **Appointments:** (Doctors, dentists, etc.).
    *   **Errands:** (Shopping, post office, etc.).
    *   **Planning & Organizing:** (Scheduling, managing paperwork, etc.).

**How to Use This Rubric:**

*   **Awareness:** Use it as a checklist to ensure you're at least *considering* each area regularly.
*   **Allocation:** Mentally (or physically, if you like) allocate blocks of time or energy to specific areas each week or day.
*   **Reflection:** Periodically (e.g., weekly) review how your time and energy were actually spent compared to how you intended, using the rubric as a guide. Where did you over-focus? Where did you neglect?
*   **Flexibility:** Understand that life happens. Some weeks will heavily favor one area (like intense job interviews), but the rubric helps you remember to re-balance in subsequent weeks.
