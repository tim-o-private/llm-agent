- User instruction for the agent to automatically read `session_log.md` at the beginning of future sessions.
- Updating the `agent_prompt.md` file to reflect the instruction for automatic session log reading.
- Confirming the immediate next step from the previous session (filling in `scheduled_tasks.md`).
- User inquiry regarding the rough token count of the context provided to the agent and agent's inability to provide this metric.

**Decisions Made:**
- User instructed the agent to automatically read `session_log.md` at the start of future sessions.
- Agent agreed to update `agent_prompt.md` with this instruction.
- Permission was granted to update `agent_prompt.md`, and the update was successfully made.

**Agreed-upon Next Steps/Action Items:**
- The agent updated `agent_prompt.md` with the instruction for automatic session log reading at startup.
- The user is working offline to fill in the "Estimated Time (mins)" and "Priority" columns in the `scheduled_tasks.md` table.
- Upon the user's return, the agent will review the updated `scheduled_tasks.md` table.
- Following the review, the next step will be to proceed with allocating and scheduling tasks based on the target weekly hours and the information in the table.
