**Session Summary**

-   **Key Topics Discussed:**
    *   Resuming the session and reading the previous session summary from `session_log.md`.
    *   Confirming access to message history and successful system refactoring.
    *   User working on and completing the assessment of the `holistic_rubric.md` areas offline.
    *   Reading and reviewing the user's completed rubric assessment (`holistic_rubric_completed.md`).
    *   Discussing and defining the user's Target State (intentional balance, fulfillment-based purpose, flexible ADHD-accommodating system).
    *   Creating a conceptual example of a balanced week/month based on the rubric areas.
    *   Going through each major area of the holistic rubric (`holistic_rubric.md`), discussing conceptual healthy balance examples, and gathering the user's specific feedback, challenges (including ADHD impact), and goals for each area.
    *   Calculating and presenting a running estimated time allocation based on the example balanced week model.
    *   Identifying Planning and System Building as the next major focus.
    *   Discussing initial strategies for capturing tasks/ideas (central inbox, quick capture methods, speech-to-text, Obsidian).
    *   Discussing the user's vision for me as an interactive task master and answering my open questions about past systems and capture methods (lack of habit, synthesis need, low friction, reminders, fragmented capture, team concept).
    *   Discussing and planning to test accessing Obsidian notes via a symlink from within my data directory.

-   **Open Topics:**
    *   Exploring the concept of "purpose" in more depth (initiated, but can be revisited).
    *   Developing strategies for improving "motivation" (linked to purpose and system building).
    *   Breaking down key areas (like the job search) into manageable steps (part of system building).
    *   Formalizing a name for the agent.
    *   Discussing the components of an effective planning system that works with ADHD.
    *   Exploring brainstorming specific tools or approaches for task initiation, time blindness, and momentum.
    *   Testing symlink access to Obsidian vault.

-   **Decisions Made:**
    *   Agreed to resume the session by reading the last session summary.
    *   Agreed that the description of the Target State is a good working definition.
    *   Agreed to update `agent_prompt.md` with the Target State description.
    *   Agreed to develop a schedule/rubric model of a balanced week/month.
    *   Agreed to use the holistic rubric areas as the framework for the model.
    *   Agreed to incorporate a running estimate of allocated hours from the example model during the rubric discussion.
    *   Agreed to update `agent_prompt.md` with the detailed rubric area assessment insights and goals.
    *   Agreed that the next major focus is Planning and System Building.
    *   Agreed on the concept of a central capture inbox (`inbox.md`) and quick capture methods, including exploring speech-to-text and Obsidian.
    *   Agreed to test symlink access from my data directory to the Obsidian vault file as a potential capture method.

-   **Agreed-upon Next Steps/Action Items:**
    *   User completed the initial rubric assessment offline and saved it to `holistic_rubric_completed.md`.
    *   I read `holistic_rubric_completed.md`.
    *   I updated the `agent_prompt.md` file with the Target State and detailed rubric assessment insights.
    *   User will set up the symlink from within my data directory (`data/agents/assistant/`) pointing to the desired file in their Obsidian vault.
    *   User will inform me of the path to the symlink file within my data directory in the next session.
    *   Upon resuming our next session, I will offer to read the session summary, and then attempt to read the symlink path using my `read_file` tool to test access.
    *   If access works, we can discuss using the Obsidian file as the primary capture inbox. If it fails, we will discuss alternative low-friction capture methods into a file located directly within my data directory.    *   I will save this session summary to `session_log.md`.
