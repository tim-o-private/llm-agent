**Key Topics Discussed:**
- Resuming the session and automatically reading the previous session summary from `session_log.md` based on the updated `agent_prompt.md` instruction.
- Confirming the immediate next step from the previous session (user filling in `scheduled_tasks.md`).
- User inquiry regarding the rough token count of the context provided to the agent and agent's inability to provide this metric.
- User stating intention to work offline on completing the `scheduled_tasks.md` table.

**Open Topics:**
- Exploring the concept of "purpose" and strategies for improving "motivation".
- Breaking down tasks into manageable steps.
- Formalizing a name for the agent.
- Discussing the components of an effective planning system for ADHD and brainstorming specific tools/approaches.
- Testing symlink access from the agent's data directory to the Obsidian vault file.
- Reviewing the completed `scheduled_tasks.md` table with estimated times and priorities.
- Allocating and scheduling tasks from `scheduled_tasks.md` based on target weekly hours.

**Decisions Made:**
- Agent automatically read `session_log.md` at the start of the session based on the previous session's decision and `agent_prompt.md` update.
- Confirmed that the next step is for the user to fill in the `scheduled_tasks.md` table.

**Agreed-upon Next Steps/Action Items:**
- The user is working offline to fill in the "Estimated Time (mins)" and "Priority" columns in the `scheduled_tasks.md` table.
- Upon the user's return, the agent will review the updated `scheduled_tasks.md` table.
- Following the review, the next step will be to proceed with allocating and scheduling tasks based on the target weekly hours and the information in the table.
