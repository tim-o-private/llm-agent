# Tools configuration needs to follow the structure expected by agent_loader.py
# Example: 
# tools_config:
#   my_search_tool:
#     toolkit: "DuckDuckGoSearchRun" # This would require DuckDuckGoSearchRun to be in TOOLKIT_MAPPING
#     scope: "PROJECT_ROOT" # Or other valid scope
#     original_name: "duckduckgo_search" # The actual tool name if the toolkit provides multiple
#     description: "A tool for searching the web with DuckDuckGo."

  web_search: # This is the name your agent will use for the tool
    toolkit: "DuckDuckGoSearchRun" # We'll map this to the actual class in agent_loader
    scope: "STANDALONE" # Using a conceptual scope for standalone tools
    original_name: "duckduckgo_search" # Standard name for this tool
