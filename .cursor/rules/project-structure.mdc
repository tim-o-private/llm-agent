# Project Structure and Requirements

ALWAYS read the contents of the files in /PRDs before writing any code.
The main product requirements and technical stack are described in [prd.md](mdc:PRDs/prd.md) and [techstack.md](mdc:PRDs/techstack.md).
After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update [prd.md](mdc:PRDs/prd.md) and [progress.md](mdc:memory-bank/progress.md).

When adding new tools or capabilities (e.g., file I/O, web search, API calls):
 1. First, search for existing, suitable LangChain tools or integrations.
 2. If found, propose using the pre-built tool.
 3. If no suitable tool exists, or if specific constraints (e.g., writing only within agent-specific directories) require it, then identify the constraint and propose creating a custom tool using LangChain standards (BaseTool/@tool, Pydantic argument schemas).

## Directory Layout (Conceptual)

- `data/`: User-managed context files (Markdown, YAML)
  - `agents/`: Context and other files to define specific agent behavior
  - `calendar/`: Local calendar data and scheduling preferences
  - `global_context/`: Personal/global context files (bio, communication style, limitations)
  - `tools/`: Folders containing tools to assist `agents` with their tasks.
- `src/`: Python source code
  - `core/`: Core logic (LLM interface, file parsing, context management)
  - `managers/`: Project and calendar management modules
  - `cli/`: Command-line interface entry point
  - `utils/`: Helper utilities (config loading, Google auth)
- `config/`: Application configuration (YAML)
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts (setup, migration, sync)
- `tests/`: Test suite
- `.gitignore`: Untracked files
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `LICENSE`: Project license

See [prd-mvp.md](mdc:PRDs/prd-mvp.md) for detailed user stories, goals, and success metrics. See [techstack-mvp.md](mdc:PRDs/techstack-mvp.md) for the selected technologies and libraries.
