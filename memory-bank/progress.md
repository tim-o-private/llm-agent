# Project Progress Log

This document tracks the active development progress for the CLI, Core Agent, Backend Systems, and overall project initiatives.

## Current Project Focus

**Status:** ACTIVE

**Recently Added/Updated:**
*   **Task Editing UI - Phase 2: Proper Separation of Concerns:** COMPLETED - Successfully refactored TaskDetailView to achieve proper separation of concerns. Created TaskModalWrapper (106 lines) for dialog logic, TaskActionBar (152 lines) for unified actions, and simplified TaskDetailView to 81 lines (65% reduction). All TypeScript compilation clean, development server running successfully.
*   **Task Editing UI/Logic Refactor:** COMPLETED - Successfully resolved critical form input bug where typing, status changes, and priority changes were not working. Root cause was infinite form reset loop in `useEditableEntity.ts` caused by unstable function dependencies in useEffect. Fixed by removing unstable dependencies from dependency array. All form inputs now work correctly.

## Refactor: Implement Robust Short-Term Memory (STM) with Persistent `session_id`

**Overall Status:** In Progress
**Associated Task:** `memory-bank/tasks.md` (NEW TASK: Refactor: Implement Robust Short-Term Memory (STM) with Persistent `session_id`)

*   **Phase 1: Database Setup**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETED
    *   **Key Outcomes:**
        *   Defined and documented DDL for `user_agent_active_sessions` table with RLS.
        *   Defined and documented DDL for `chat_message_history` table (compatible with `langchain-postgres`) with RLS.
        *   All DDL changes applied to `memory-bank/clarity/ddl.sql`.
    *   **Completion Date:** {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}

*   **Phase 2: Backend (`chatServer/main.py`) Adjustments**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETED
    *   **Key Outcomes:**
        *   `ChatRequest` model updated to require `session_id`.
        *   `chat_endpoint` refactored to use client-provided `session_id`, `PostgresChatMessageHistory`, and `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`.
        *   Old server-side session caching logic removed.
        *   Verified usage of correct table name for chat history and `PGEngine` initialization.
    *   **Completion Date:** {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}

*   **Phase 3: Client-Side (`webApp`) Implementation**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETED
    *   **Key Outcomes:**
        *   Created `useChatSessionHooks.ts` for fetching/upserting active sessions and generating session IDs.
        *   Refactored `useChatStore.ts` with new `initializeSessionAsync` logic (localStorage, DB lookup, new session generation) and removed client-side batch archival.
        *   Updated `ChatPanel.tsx` to use the new store logic and send `session_id` to the backend.
        *   Removed redundant client-side archival code (`useChatApiHooks.ts`) and DDL (`recent_conversation_history`).
    *   **Completion Date:** {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}

*   **Phase 4: Testing & Refinement**
    *   **Status:** In Progress - Core Functionality Restored, New Issues Identified
    *   **Key Outcomes & Current State (as of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC):**
        *   **RESOLVED:** Major PostgreSQL connection issues preventing server startup and basic chat history operations. The root cause was an incorrect database URL in the environment configuration.
        *   **Short-term memory (STM) via `PostgresChatMessageHistory`:** VERIFIED WORKING. Messages are being saved to and retrieved from the database during a session.
        *   **Long-term memory (LTM) DB writes (conceptual, if separate):** VERIFIED WORKING (Assuming this refers to any LTM mechanisms tested alongside STM).
        *   **NEW ISSUE:** Session IDs appear not to be persisted correctly to the database or are not being correctly associated with users/chat histories across server restarts or new client sessions. This needs investigation.
        *   **NEW ISSUE:** Noticeable latency in chat responses. This may be due to database operations, agent processing, or network. Further investigation with timestamps in logs is planned.
        *   **Action Item:** User will resume detailed testing plan in the morning.
        *   **Action Item:** Add timestamps to server logs for latency analysis.
    *   **Next Steps:**
        1.  Investigate session ID persistence.
        2.  Add detailed timestamps to `chatServer/main.py` logs.
        3.  Conduct thorough testing based on user's plan.
        4.  Address identified latency issues.

*   **Phase 5: Code Cleanup & Documentation**
    *   **Status:** Pending

    *   **Key Activities & Status:**
        *   Define/migrate schema for `recent_conversation_history` with RLS. (Status: DONE)
        *   Create `/api/chat/session/archive_messages` endpoint. (Status: DONE - To be deprecated)
        *   Refactor `webApp/src/api/hooks/useChatApiHooks.ts` for direct Supabase client writes (Status: DONE)
        *   Update `webApp/src/stores/useChatStore.ts` for session management, archival triggers, and direct Supabase writes via `doArchiveChatDirect`. (Status: DONE)
        *   Install `uuid` and `@types/uuid`. (Status: DONE)
        *   Fix linter errors in `webApp/src/api/types.ts` and `webApp/src/api/hooks/useTaskHooks.ts`. (Status: DONE)
        *   Integrate `agentId` into `ChatPanel` and initialize `useChatStore` correctly. (Status: DONE)
        *   Align client-side data synchronization triggers (tasks vs. chat archival). (Status: DEFERRED - Separate mechanisms acceptable for now)
    *   **Next Steps:** Test client archival triggers and direct Supabase batch storage (after core agent execution is unblocked).

*   **Phase 3: Integrating Short-Term Context Flow & Debugging Core Agent Execution**
    *   **Status:** In Progress (Gemini API Error RESOLVED)
    *   **Objective:** Enable robust conversational flow by correctly managing short-term message history and resolving core agent execution errors with the Gemini model.
    *   **Key Activities & Status:**
        *   Modify client `/api/chat` calls (send only new messages). (Status: To Do)
        *   Refactor `chatServer` `/api/chat` endpoint for `server_session_cache` and new client messages. (Status: To Do)
        *   Ensure `CustomizableAgentExecutor` processes assembled short-term history. (Status: In Progress)
        *   **[RESOLVED]** `InvalidArgument: 400 * GenerateContentRequest.contents[X].parts: contents.parts must not be empty.` error occurring after tool calls with Gemini model.
            *   **Resolution:** Correctly configured the agent to use `format_to_tool_messages` and `ToolsAgentOutputParser` for handling tool calls with Gemini.
        *   E2E testing of conversational flow. (Status: To Do - Unblocked)

*   **Phase 3.1: CRUD Tool DB Migration & Refinement**
    *   **Status:** In Progress
    *   **Objective:** Ensure all CRUD tool definitions are fully migrated to database configuration, and refine `crud_tool.py` for simplicity and robustness.
    *   **Key Activities & Status:**
        *   Verified `
