## **Design Brief: ADHD Planning Assistant (Working Title: Clarity)**

### **1. Product Vision**

A cross-platform planning app that serves as an executive function assistant for adults with ADHD. It combines daily planning, motivational nudges, and distraction management in a calming, focused, and emotionally supportive interface.

---

### **2. Design Goals**
- **Low friction**: Make adding, reviewing, and completing tasks as simple and fast as possible.
- **Neurodivergent-friendly**: Reduce cognitive load, visual clutter, and decision fatigue. 
- **Emotionally positive**: Reinforce self-efficacy with small wins, not guilt or pressure.
- **Context aware:** Assume that users have tried at this before. Avoid being pedantic.
- **Modular but consistent**: Scalable UI that works across web and mobile without overwhelming users.

---

### **3. Core Use Cases (MVP)**

- Quickly add tasks for today or later via text or voice
- View and check off today’s plan in a clean “Today” view
- Activate a focus timer and enter a distraction-free mode
- Brain-dump stray thoughts to clear mental clutter
- Receive helpful nudges (via chat or banner) when off-track
- Reflect on progress with a “done list” or light journaling

---

### **4. Brand & Tone**

- **Tone**: Friendly, non-judgmental, supportive—like a smart coach or trusted companion.
- **Visual Style**: Calm and minimal, with occasional joyful touches (e.g., confetti after a task).
- **Typography**: Large, readable sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Work Sans).
* **Color palette**: Muted base with 1-2 accent colors. Consider light/dark themes or stimulation-level toggles.

### **5. Layout Priorities**

- **Home (“Today”) View**: The heart of the app. Shows a focused list of today’s tasks, a big “+” button to add a task, and access to the timer or coach.    
- **Focus Mode**: One task on screen, countdown timer, minimal navigation. No distractions.
- **Coach Panel**: Available via a button or notification; opens as a side panel or modal to offer planning/reflection prompts.
- **Add Task Flow**: Fast, keyboard/voice-friendly. Required: task name. Optional: due date/time, category, value tag, link to doc.

---

### **6. Accessibility & UX Standards**

- Minimal choices per screen (3–4 max)    
- Strong visual hierarchy (titles, buttons, etc.)
- Consistent navigation layout (bottom nav bar or persistent sidebar)
- All animations are optional/user-triggered
- ADA/WCAG compliant color contrast and navigation

3. **Focus Timer Screen**
