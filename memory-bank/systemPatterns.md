# System Patterns

This document is intended to house high-level system-wide architectural patterns and diagrams that might not fit specifically into `techContext.md` (which covers stack, specific implementation patterns, and data models) or `productContext.md` (which covers product vision, features, and user flows).

**Initial State (Post-Consolidation - YYYY-MM-DD):**

Much of the content from a previous version of `systemPatterns.md` (which included architectural diagrams) has been summarized or integrated into `techContext.md` (see "System Architecture Overview" which references original Mermaid diagrams) and relevant implementation patterns have also been moved there.

**Guidelines for Use:**

*   Use this document for overarching patterns that span multiple components or layers of the system (CLI, WebApp, API, Database) if they are not adequately covered in `techContext.md`.
*   Consider this for high-level visual diagrams (e.g., C4 model diagrams, complex sequence diagrams) if `techContext.md` becomes too verbose.
*   If `techContext.md`'s sections on "System Architecture Overview" and "Key Implementation Patterns" are sufficient, this file may remain high-level or be formally deprecated in favor of consolidating all technical patterns within `techContext.md`.

**To Be Determined:**

*   Does a distinct `systemPatterns.md` add value beyond what is now in `techContext.md`? If so, what specific content should live here exclusively?
