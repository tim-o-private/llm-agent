# Active Context

**Last Task Archived:** Task 9: Architect and Implement `useEditableEntity` Hook & Refactor `TaskDetailView`
**Archive Document:** `memory-bank/archive/archive-task9.md`

**Immediate Focus / Next Steps:**
1.  **[ACTIVE] CLI/Core Backend MVP Testing (Task 3.1 from `memory-bank/tasks.md`):** 
    *   Core agent memory persistence via Supabase is now **working**.
    *   The `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` issue during tool execution by the `CustomizableAgent` is **resolved**.
    *   Current focus for Task 3.1: Manually test and verify persistence of prompt customizations using the `UpdateSelfInstructionsTool` and related `PromptManagerService` and API endpoints.

**Next Action:** Complete all aspects of Task 3.1 (Manual Testing of Backend MVP). Then, identify the next P0 or P1 task from `memory-bank/tasks.md`.

**Mode Recommendation:** PLAN (after Task 3.1 completion)

**General Project Goal:** Stabilize and enhance the Clarity UI. Concurrently, progress on CLI and Core system enhancements, particularly completing the backend MVP validation.

**Pending Decisions/Questions:**
*   What is the next P0 or P1 task to focus on from `memory-bank/tasks.md` after Task 3.1 is fully completed?
