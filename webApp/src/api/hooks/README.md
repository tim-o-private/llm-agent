# API Hooks

This directory contains custom React Query hooks for interacting with the backend API (e.g., Supabase).

Each hook should encapsulate the logic for fetching, mutating, and caching data related to a specific resource or endpoint.

Refer to Pattern 5 in `memory-bank/clarity/implementationPatterns.md` for guidelines.
